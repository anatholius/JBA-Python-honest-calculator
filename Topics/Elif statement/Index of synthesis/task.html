  <div data-v-c46181e4=""><p>One way to classify the languages of the world is by looking at their morphological systems. One classification is based on the <strong>index of synthesis </strong>that reflects the average number of morphemes in a word. The values vary between 1 and 4 and there are 3 types of languages according to that system. Here they are:</p>

<p><strong>Type — Index</strong></p>

<p>Analytic — less than 2</p>

<p>Synthetic — from 2 to 3 (inclusively)</p>

<p>Polysynthetic — more than 3</p>

<p>Write a program that given the index of synthesis determines the type of the language.</p>

<p><strong>The input format:</strong></p>

<p>The value of the index of synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>The output format:</strong></p>

<p>The type of language.</p></div>
